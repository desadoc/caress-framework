# Caress-Lib, a lua library for game programming.

This project is a library derived from a former framework. It holds almost the
same purpose that the framework, but in a simpler approach, more like a
library, free from references to any game engine/framework and with less
assumptions on application architecture.

## Features

Currently it has:

 * Some useful data structures
 * A class system and some base classes
 * Utilities for async code that gives this library it's name
