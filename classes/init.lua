--- Class system module.
--
-- This module acts as a class path system for classes implemented in lua.
-- It needs to be loaded and initialized with folders containing class source
-- files.
--
-- It supports inheritance, method/field shadowing and static fields.
--
-- Some methods/fields have special meaning when implementing a class:
--
-- _class:init()
--
-- This optional method is also used for initialization after the object is
-- fully constructed, it's optional.
--
-- _class.initClass()
--
-- Like init(), but for initializing static members.
--
-- _class:main(cohandler)
--
-- Caress function that should be run at some moment after the object is
-- initialized. It can be handily run with self:start().
--
-- self.class
--
-- Class object. Has some useful methods like an isA operator and
-- getCompleteName().
--
-- @module classes
